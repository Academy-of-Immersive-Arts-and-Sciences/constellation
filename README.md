# Constellation

**Because it will take a CONSTELLATION of standards to achieve the open Metaverse.**

---

Welcome to the future home of **Constellation**, a collaboration between the Academy of Immersive Arts and Sciences and Metaverse Standards Forum to create an immersive 3D visualization appliction to navigate the complex landscape of standards, starting with GeoSpatial Standards, tne  expanding to all immersive standards and eventually will serve as a foundation to Wiki3dia.org.


## **Mission**
Constellation is dedicated to:
- **Driving interoperability** through open standards for the Metaverse.
- **Empowering developers** with robust tools for building Web3D, WebXR, and WebGPU experiences.
- **Fostering innovation** by integrating advanced 3D libraries and frameworks.

## **Core Features**
Although in its early stages, the following libraries and technologies are being actively integrated:

### **3D Visualization**
- **[3D Force Graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/3d-force-graph):** Dynamic 3D force-directed graphs for visualizing complex data relationships.

### **Immersive Technologies**
- **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/):** The gold standard for creating 3D experiences on the web.
- **[@react-three/fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber):** Declarative React bindings for Three.js.
- **[Troika-3D](https://github.com/protectwise/troika):** High-performance 3D rendering with declarative design.
- **[CesiumJS](https://cesium.com/cesiumjs/):** For creating rich, interactive, and immersive geospatial experiences.

### **WebXR (Virtual and Augmented Reality)**
- **3D Force Graph VR/AR Versions:** Extending force-directed graph visualization to immersive VR and AR environments.

### **Data Visualization**
- **CesiumJS:** High-performance geospatial rendering for large-scale data visualization.

## **Roadmap**
1. **Core Setup:**
   - Establish robust workflows using Lerna and npm workspaces.
   - Integrate key libraries for visualization and spatial computing.

2. **Prototype Development:**
   - Create proof-of-concept applications for 3D data visualization, VR/AR interactions, and geospatial mapping.

3. **Community Engagement:**
   - Open discussions around standards and best practices for interoperability in the Metaverse.

4. **MVP Release:**
   - Launch the first iteration of Constellation, showcasing its potential to developers worldwide.
